# practical-auth-flow

Description: This project is a comprehensive authentication and authorization system built to enhance the security and user management aspects of web applications. It provides seamless user registration, login functionalities, and employs JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for robust authentication and authorization processes. The system integrates with various essential dependencies, such as bcrypt for password hashing, cors for cross-origin resource sharing, and mongoose for interacting with MongoDB databases.

Key Features:

User Registration: Allows users to create new accounts securely. It employs advanced encryption techniques, utilizing bcrypt for password hashing, ensuring the confidentiality of user credentials.

User Authentication: The system provides a seamless and secure login process for registered users. It leverages JWT to verify user identities, enhancing the authentication process with a token-based approach.

Authorization: This project implements a comprehensive authorization mechanism that restricts access to certain resources or functionalities based on user roles and permissions. This helps maintain data integrity and user privacy.

User Profile Management: Users can manage their profiles and update their information. The system ensures that only authorized users can modify their own profiles, enhancing data security.

Token-Based Security: JWT tokens are used to manage user sessions, enhancing security and minimizing the need to repeatedly authenticate users for each request.

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): CORS support is integrated to enable secure communication between the front-end and back-end, ensuring a smooth user experience.

API Documentation: The system includes API documentation powered by Swagger UI Express, allowing developers to easily understand and interact with the available endpoints.

Real-time Development: Nodemon is incorporated to facilitate real-time development by automatically restarting the server upon code changes.

This project offers a comprehensive solution for user management, authentication, and authorization in web applications. By leveraging modern security practices and industry-standard technologies, it ensures that user data remains secure while providing a seamless experience for both developers and end-users.
